I have had some experience with web scraping. But almost all of them were for a very specific purpose. To make a generalised spider was new to me. To start off with, i searched the internet for the techniques used in same. I had a basic model in mind and first implemented that. I came across some new things such as PhantomJs, CASPERJS, cheerio, etc, but decided against using them, and started coding from the scratch. I created a basic spider and then worked on optimising it. Due to lack of time (I had my university exams), the application is not thoroughly tested, but I am pretty confident it would pass most of the test cases.
